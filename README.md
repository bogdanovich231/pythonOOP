# Hermetization Polymorphism Abstraction

## List of tasks

- An ice cream stand is a special kind of restaurant. Define a class named IceCreamStand inheriting from the Restaurant class. Add an attribute named flavors, storing a list of different ice cream flavors. Define a method that displays the available ice cream flavors. Suggest other methods. Add a class named CoffeeShop inheriting from the Restaurant class. Add an attribute named coffee, storing a list of different coffees, e.g. americano, latte. Define a method to display the available coffees. Propose methods. Propose the creation of objects. Does this task fit into the issue of abstraction,inheritance, encapsulation and polymorphism?
- Write a program representing an object-oriented system that evaluates products from the Beer class. Propose individual fields, e.g., categories, percentage concentration, price, opinion space. Propose the ability to sort by ratings and names.
Propose a Store class. What methods and fields will you propose that the Beer class could use the Store class?
- Write a program that creates a class Citizen with fields: first name, last name, street_number, postal_code, city. Write a constructor and a method that loads the data, and a function that displays as a business card and prints it to a file, such as:
