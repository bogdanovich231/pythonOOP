# Reading and writing from/to a file. The enum function enumerate() . Stacks and queues.

## Task list:
- Save the invocation of Pan Tadeusz by Adam Mickiewicz in a notepad in a file named pantadeusz.txt Next load the function with open. What does the text look like? Can it be read without any problems? What differences do you see in using only the strip or split function?
Suggest a solution to the text readability problems
- In the invocation of Pan Tadeusz display 8, 12, 60,98, 104 lines. Do the lines display correctly? Check how many lines the invocation has.Use the enumerate function
- Implement the stack by queue or queue by stack operation for 50 selected numbers, 100 selected numbers and 150 numbers. Compare the execution time of the algorithm. How will the time change when the data is loaded using a file? Save the times to a file in .txt format
- Write a mound sort for the entered sequence of numbers 4, 10, 11,5,73, 5, 1. Compare the time of of execution of this algorithm with the time of execution of fast sort for these data input data. Suggest loading numbers from file level in any format. For how many maximum values entered will the algorithm stop executing? Save the results in .txt format
