## List task: 
- Write a program that checks if the string of numbers given by the user is the Polish postal code. If it is not the program should return an exception. Each correctly entered postal code should be added at the very end to the file named postalcodes.txt. How will the program change when we want to create a pr ogram using US postal codes.
